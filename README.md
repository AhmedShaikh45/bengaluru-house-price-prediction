# 🏠 Bengaluru House Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict house prices in Bengaluru based on location, size, total square feet, number of bedrooms, and other features.

This project demonstrates end-to-end data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation for real estate price prediction.
